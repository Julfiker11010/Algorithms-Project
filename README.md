# Algorithms-Project
This is the Algorithm project named Document Similarity Checker Using LCS, that I made my Algorithm course CSE246. 
This project relates to the real world like
1. Plagiarism Detection
2. Code Similarity Checking
3. Text Comparison Tools

And the project help me to understand Dynamic Programming, time and space complexity awareness, string processing skills, problem solving and logical thinking.
